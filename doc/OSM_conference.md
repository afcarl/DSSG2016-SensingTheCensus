Takeaways from State of the Map conference 2016

The following three talks were my favorite ones from OSM conference. 

####Mapping social well-being indicators on the map of developing countries 
There is a non-profit called “Humanitarian Open Street Map Team (HOT)” who are mapping socail well-being indicators on the OSM. UN made a Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) with 8 dimensions such as education and health, and they’re extending it to 17 indicators. The HOT is mapping these 17 indicators onto the maps of developing countries. For now, they’re targeting 4 countries in Africa and south-east Asia.
Tyler Redford, an Executive Director from HOT, had a talk yesterday about their work. 

I had a chat with him today, and he was very nice. He said his organization needed partnerships with many research institutions because research is rarely done with their MPI indicators on the map.

The UN report about Sustainable Development Index is available at http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/natlinfo/indicators/guidelines.pdf


####The Crowd behind OSM
Dr. Sterling Quinn, an assistant professor from Central Washington University in Geography department (and PSU Geography graduate) presented about a visual analytics tool for recognizing different users who contributed to OSM. His work was very interesting, because his analyses might be helpful in understanding how geospatial information is created online, and what the impact of organizational/institutional interventions is. 

So I talked to him after his presentation. He was glad to share the sample data and answer any questions in the future. But for now the target regions are limited to several rectangles.
The link is a visual analytics interface by him: http://sterlingquinn.net/apps/crowdlens/


####Rewarding systems on OSM 
Marc Farrah from a non-profit called Development Seed presented about rewarding system to motivate people in contributing to the OSM.
The rewarding system itself has not been developed yet, but his classifications of mappers were interesting. He classified mappers into three categories.

- idealistic mappers — who map their local community.
- reactive mappers — who map information only for some reasons such as a natural disaster. 
- institutional mapping — institutional interventions to add data onto the map.

I think this classifications might be helpful in understanding the data. 

--------
Other then that, most of them were about techniques and tools to add/analyze/use the OSM data. Several other interesting talks are as follows: 

#### Increasing Participation with Field Papers (@linzjax from CADASTA)

- The goal is to involve more community members so they have ownership
	- lower the barrier to participation (training)
	- find a way to include people typically left out due to lack of access to tech (resources)
- E.g., Kosovo Cadastral Agency (KCA)
	- paper-based method
- Participatory mapping project — Problem: community accessibility + limited resources
	- Drones
	- Train a limited group
	- invest in tablets (high cost, low participation rate)
	- Final solution: paper-based approach (field papers) http://fieldpapers.org/
        1. make an atlas using a tool 
        2. scan it back to the system
        3. Cadastsa+ Outreach + Field Papers
        
#### Drones for mapping 
- Useful tools
	- OpenDrawMap — automatically tag geo-data (http://mapcarta.com?)
	- OpenArielMap
	- TerraPattern: detecting geospatial features on a map image
	- SNAPSAT
- Overarching question: how to integrate UAV-based images and aerial maps?
- Mapping the Meta
    1.  https://github.com/ToeBee/ChangesetMD, Tobby Murray
    2. Changeset density is different by state.
    3. Changeset: comments, source tags, and tags. Information about how, when, and from where OSM gets its map data.

- Behind the scenes of the Mapzen Targeted Editing Series (@IndyMapper)
    1. A series: a set of blog posts
    2. Provide what are correctly entered as polygons or tagged and what are not by country
        1. views vs. tags — statistics
    3. Topics Tags — limitations + “Tiles”
